**Common Features of the Best GTA 5 Mod Menus:**

   Mod menus allow players to spawn any vehicle in the game instantly, from cars and trucks to planes and helicopters, enabling quicker access to transportation or simply exploring the world.

3. **Aimbots and God Mode**:

   Teleport anywhere on the map instantly, whether to specific locations or to random spots, saving time and allowing for easy exploration.

7. **Online Mode Mods**:  
   Some mod menus can be used in GTA 5’s online mode, providing additional features like money drops, weapon customizations, and player modifications. However, using mods in GTA Online is risky, as it can result in account bans if caught.
